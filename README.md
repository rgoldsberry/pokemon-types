## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to build a web site that can tell you what moves you should or should not hit a Pokémon with when you're in a battle. Nine generations worth of 'mon is far too many for one brain to remember. 

Mechanically, it was a chance to work with API calls, regular expressions, and Flask application building with SQLite database files.
